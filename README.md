# **Crop Recommendation System**

## **Overview**
The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers select the most suitable crops based on key agricultural parameters, including soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The objective of this project is to enhance agricultural decision-making by providing data-driven crop recommendations, reducing uncertainty, and improving farm productivity. It leverages the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm, which is effective for classification tasks with continuous numerical features. This system offers several benefits, Increased crop yield by helping farmers choose the most suitable crops for their land. Cost efficiency by reducing wasted resources on unsuitable crops, and Sustainable farming practices by optimizing soil health and minimizing environmental impact. By integrating AI into agriculture, this project empowers farmers with precise insights, leading to smarter and more profitable farming decisions.
